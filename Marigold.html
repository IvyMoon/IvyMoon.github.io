        <p>Thunder grumbled in the distance, its angry echoes reverberating over the
        mountaintop and into the nearby valley. The forest below awoke from its
        slumber at the sound. A shiver rolled through the trees, sending silent
        whispers with the wind as leaves rustled about. It was 8:30 PM, and the
        night was darker than usual. Much darker. Blackness cloaked everything,
        pervaded everything, was everything. The moon was nowhere to be seen,
        its luminescence hidden by stormy clouds.<br ><br >
        Thunder rumbled again, this time louder. Its doomful sound became one
        with the night, inspiring fear in everything around. The katydids&#39;
        incessant buzzing stopped abruptly. The barn owls took shelter under
        their wings. All was quiet except for the murmur of the trees. Something
        ominous was here, a baleful sense of fate perhaps, just waiting for the
        right soul to wander in and meet its demise...(<a href="Strange_Attraction.html">read more</a>)</p>

        <p>The marshmallow climbed out of his bag, turning the air around him sweet and delightful.<br>
        "Oh my!" He exclaimed. "I must be brave in this new world."<br><br>
        And so, he began exploring the kitchen. Strolling past a bag of little
        chocolate chips, he gasped with surprise.<br>
        "My, oh my," he thought. "Those poor little succulents, stuck in there..."<br>
        Suddenly, a thought occurred to him! He shivered with a thrill of anticipation.
        Unable to contain his excitement, he began wiggling all his parts and started doing jumping-jacks.<br>
        "My, oh my, what an excellent idea," he thought to himself.<br><br>
        And so, without further ado, he released the chocolate chips.<br>
        Down and down they poured, out of the bag and all over the countertop,
        their squeals of joy high-pitched and annoying.<br><br>

        The marshmallow smiled and applauded himself for this act of justice.
        Keeping food locked up in bags was foul, the epitome of injustice.<br>
        Who would do such a thing?...

        <p>The air was frigid, as was the chimney sweep's heart. Standing atop
        mansions, cleaning the nobility's chimneys was cumbersome work.
        Especially during the winter. His clothes were always soiled, smeared
        with black soot. His face, normally pale as snow, took on the ashen hue
        of someone who had already lost everything.<br><br>
        He guessed he had. Standing this particular morning, on the Grand Duke's
        chimney, he felt weary. The sun had not yet risen, and the air was cold.
        This was his favorite time of day. Nobody else was awake, giving him time
        to look up at the sky as dawn approached. He could see a faint glimmer of
        stars, fading as the sun slowly started to rise...

         <p>The orange pumpkin laughed degradingly at himself.<br><br>
           It was early evening on Halloween night, and he sat all alone on a brick doorstep,
           watching the clouds roll by with their hues of ominous gray. The wind was chilly,
           and he shivered at the thought of the horrible wrong that'd been done to him. The
           knowledge was painful, but the experience had been far worse. And he had scars to prove it.<br><br>
           "Bah humbug," he said. His words were crisp on the frigid air.<br><br>
           He liked how it sounded&#8212;talking out loud to himself. He continued on.<br><br>
