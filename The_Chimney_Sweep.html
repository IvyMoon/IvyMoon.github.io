        <p>
          The air was frigid, as was the chimney sweep's heart. Standing atop
          mansions, cleaning the nobility's chimneys was cumbersome work.
          Especially during the winter. His clothes were always soiled, smeared
          with black soot. His face, normally pale as snow, took on the ashen hue
          of someone who had already lost everything.<br><br>

          He guessed he had. Standing this particular morning, on the Grand Duke's
          chimney, he felt weary. The sun had not yet risen, and the air was cold.
          This was his favorite time of day. Nobody else was awake, giving him time
          to look up at the sky as dawn approached. He could see a faint glimmer of
          stars, fading as the sun slowly started to rise.<br><br>

          And then he thought of her. The only girl his heart would ever beat for.
          The one girl that he had always dreamed of being with. As far away from
          his reach as the moon. They had never spoken, except for an occasional
          hello when passing. She was the Grand Duke's daughter. As unapproachable
          as girls ever come. But when their eyes met, he knew that there was some
          deep connection between them. Like two ancient souls recognizing their
          shared past way back in time. He had never felt like this around any other
          girl, and it warmed his heart remembering their shared glances.<br><br>

          But alas, his heart was full of sorrow. Standing atop the chimney this
          frigid morning, covered in ash and soot, he started remembering what he
          wished he would not. Closing his eyes, he saw the girl before him. Her
          soulful blue eyes, long pale blond hair, and skin that smelled of moon
          lilies, intoxicating him with her very presence. He smiled sadly at the
          thought of her, and a tear slid slowly down his cheek.<br><br>

          Opening his eyes, more tears began to fall. Dawn was about to
          break. As he looked out over the horizon, he tried holding back quiet
          sobs. She was gone. And the memory of her imprisoned him in an endless
          pool of despair. A horse carriage accident had transported her from this
          life to the next. There would be no more tomorrows for her, and he was
          saddened by the thought of a future that could have been but never will
          be. Standing above everyone and everything on the chimney, he looked up
          at the sky and felt like he was one step closer to reaching her. Perhaps
          she was watching him from above. Suddenly, the sun peeked over the
          skyline, and a sliver of hope slid into his heart. Still consumed by
          grief, his heart was as still as the icy morning air. But the hint of
          sunshine granted him momentary reprieve from his gloom, reminding him of
          his dearly departed's radiance and love of all things light.
          And so, looking at the sunrise, he knew he would see her again someday.
          They were soulmates after all.

        slumber at the sound. A shiver rolled through the trees, sending silent
        whispers with the wind as leaves rustled about. It was 8:30 PM, and the
        night was darker than usual. Much darker. Blackness cloaked everything,
        pervaded everything, was everything. The moon was nowhere to be seen,
