          "The moon was luminescent, the sky was starry, and Humphrey was hungry.<br><br>
          Scampering across the luscious grass this fine evening, Humphrey let out a cry of agitation.
          Where was a garbage can?<br><br>
          Every night, Humphrey made his way to the trash, the epitome of what he considered fine dining.
          Half-eaten hamburgers, remnants of chocolate donuts, leftover noodles, and his all-time-favorite
          food, chicken.<br><br>
          This evening, Humphrey had arrived at his normal time (exactly 10:02 pm) at the residence of Mr. Ricardo.<br>
          But alas! Mr. Ricardo's trash can was missing.<br>
          Humphrey suspected his brother, Bob, had stolen it in retaliation for eating the delectable McDonald's
          hamburger they found earlier that week in Mr. Ricardo's trash. While Bob wasn't looking, Humphrey
          had stuffed the entire hamburger into his mouth with his paws.<br><br>
          When Bob asked what happened to the hamburger, Humphrey said it magically floated away into the second
          dimension of the universe. Bob raised his furry eyebrow at the proclamation but said nothing. He didn't
          buy it one bit.<br><br>
          And so presently, with no garbage can in sight, Humphrey sadly left Mr. Ricardo's yard in search of a
          meal elsewhere. Bob had made his point loud and clear. Share food with your raccoon brother, or else
          your garbage can will disappear."

          No, I have not. You are quite the bothersome frog, Willard. Shall I call security and have you thrown out
          the window like the pest you know you are?<br><br>
          No, sir. If I'm thrown out the window, I can't fly like you. You're a crane and I'm a frog.

          An evergreen leaf is attached to a tree.<br>
          It has been there since the spring,<br>
          Blowing in the wind,<br>
          And shivering in the cold night's air.<br>
          Winter is coming.<br>
          It knows that Winter is cold.<br>
          But more than that, it sees Winter's intent.<br>
          Winter doesn't just freeze things.<br>
          Winter consumes any warmth it can find,<br>
          Enveloping all the good in its icy embrace <br>
          And freezing away its hope.<br>
          So that all that's left is a deep pit of cold <br>
          Nothingness.<br>
          The evergreen leaf knows that Winter will consume it.<br>
          The evergreen leaf is awaiting its arrival with dread.
