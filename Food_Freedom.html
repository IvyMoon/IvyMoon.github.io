        <p>
          The marshmallow climbed out of his bag, turning the air around him sweet and delightful.<br>
          "Oh my!" He exclaimed. "I must be brave in this new world."<br><br>

          And so, he began exploring the kitchen. Strolling past a bag of little
          chocolate chips, he gasped with surprise.<br>
          "My, oh my," he thought. "Those poor little succulents, stuck in there..."<br>
          Suddenly, a thought occurred to him! He shivered with a thrill of anticipation.
          Unable to contain his excitement, he began wiggling all his parts and started doing jumping-jacks.<br>
          "My, oh my, what an excellent idea," he thought to himself.<br><br>

          And so, without further ado, he released the chocolate chips.<br>
          Down and down they poured, out of the bag and all over the countertop,
          their squeals of joy high-pitched and annoying.<br><br>

          The marshmallow smiled and applauded himself for this act of justice.
          Keeping food locked up in bags was foul, the epitome of injustice.<br>
          Who would do such a thing?<br><br>

          And so, the marshmallow took it upon himself to release all the foods from their bags and containers.
          One by one, each was set free.<br>
          The peanuts (nutty as they were) decided to visit Planters, where they supposed their father lived.<br>
          The skittles skitted on by, planning to see a rainbow.<br>
          The Goldfish, upon seeing the half-filled sink, jumped in and began to swim.
          Realizing too late their cracker origins, they became soggy and disintegrated.
          Poor little fishies.<br><br>

          Next, the marshmallow opened the refrigerator, huffing and puffing like fluffy white marshmallows do.
          The refrigerator's cold white light shone down on the floor, illuminating
          scurrying skittles scattering everywhere.<br>
          Apparently, they were in pandemonium.<br>
          Their leader, the dashingly handsome Mr. S, no longer knew which way was north.
          Having lost all sense of direction, he now danced with a chocolate chip that had fallen on the floor.<br><br>

          The marshmallow looked on with humorous eyes, a smile creeping onto his face.<br>
          "This is how the world should be!" he screamed from a shelf inside the fridge.
          "Free food everywhere!!! This must be exactly like a buffet!"<br><br>

          Continuing on his quest, the marshmallow opened more bags and sealed containers.<br>
          Corn cobs rolled out of a bag, eyeballing the microwave with interest.<br>
          The tomatoes bickered amongst each other, arguing over who's skin was redder.<br>
          And the ice cubes, having never experienced tempereature >32 degrees Fahrenheit,
          considered melting a revelation: they believed they were transcending to a higher form.<br>
          Yes, indeed.<br>
          Soon, they were merely water puddles, evaporating into the air and becoming one with the atmosphere.<br><br>

          Shortly thereafter, the marshmallow finished his job. Every food had been set free.
          But looking down on the crowd, the marshmallow inwardly cringed: the food had run amuck.<br><br>

          The corncobs had stuck one of their own kind inside the microwave, watching him turn into popcorn.<br>
          Next, some of the peanuts were doubting their common ancestry.<br>
          One peanut believed another was too salty, citing him as a distant cousin.<br>
          And the tomatoes' debate over skin pigmentation had escalated into a heated falling-out.<br>
          There was yelling all around, and one tomato called another "ketchup" (which was quite the insult).<br><br>

          The marshmallow realized that food freedom had come at a cost: anarchy.<br><br>

          In an effort to restore order, the marshmallow reached for the nearest chocolate chip,
          placed it on his head like a top hat, and both it and the marshmallow called for order.<br>
          Nobody listened.<br><br>

          That sly Mr. S began tap-dancing wildly, his feet going every which way.<br>
          A tomato entered a frenzy, and as maniacal anger overtook him, he became the reddest one of the bunch.<br>
          The tomatoes' dispute had finally been settled.<br>
          And maddeningly, a group of little chocolate chips cried hysterically (they were babies, after all).<br><br>

          The marshmallow slumped, overburdened by the weight of it all.
          The day's events had deflated and dried him out, so he was no longer puffy.<br>
          He no longer felt like the marshmallow he'd once been. Instead, he felt unscrupulous
          and untasty, a disgrace to all marshmallow kind.<br><br>

          He looked toward the bag from which he had come with a look of longing in his eyes.<br>
          His marshmellow kin, sweet and amiable as they were, waited for his
          return.<br>
          "Hmmm...perhaps my work is done," he thought.<br>
          He made eye contact with a fellow marshmallow smiling at him from within
          the bag and decided enough was enough.<br>
          "Indeed," he thought. "My revolution is over."<br>
          The marshmallow noted, however, the chaos of the food and the turmoil that
          had arisen. Inside the bag, marshmallows smiled at him, yet
          some of their grins seemed a little too big, vindictive almost.<br>
          The marshmallow didn't know if he wanted to go back into the bag.
          Mustering up as much courage as possible, he huffed and puffed himself into
          some decent resemblance of a fluffy marshmallow and entered the bag.<br><br>

          Giggling ensued (the marshmallow way of gossiping).<br>
          The revolutionist marshmallow kept his puff alive, smiling at his kinsfolk,
          and contemplated the future of food in the kitchen.<br><br>

          Food would have to be brave in this new world.

        <p>Thunder grumbled in the distance, its angry echoes reverberating over the
        mountaintop and into the nearby valley. The forest below awoke from its
        slumber at the sound. A shiver rolled through the trees, sending silent
        whispers with the wind as leaves rustled about. It was 8:30 PM, and the
        night was darker than usual. Much darker. Blackness cloaked everything,
        pervaded everything, was everything. The moon was nowhere to be seen,
        its luminescence hidden by stormy clouds.<br ><br >
        Thunder rumbled again, this time louder. Its doomful sound became one
        with the night, inspiring fear in everything around. The katydids&#39;
        incessant buzzing stopped abruptly. The barn owls took shelter under
        their wings. All was quiet except for the murmur of the trees. Something
        ominous was here, a baleful sense of fate perhaps, just waiting for the

        <p>The air was frigid, as was the chimney sweep's heart. Standing atop
        mansions, cleaning the nobility's chimneys was cumbersome work.
        Especially during the winter. His clothes were always soiled, smeared
        with black soot. His face, normally pale as snow, took on the ashen hue
        of someone who had already lost everything.<br><br>
        He guessed he had. Standing this particular morning, on the Grand Duke's
        chimney, he felt weary. The sun had not yet risen, and the air was cold.
        This was his favorite time of day. Nobody else was awake, giving him time
        to look up at the sky as dawn approached. He could see a faint glimmer of
        stars, fading as the sun slowly started to rise...
